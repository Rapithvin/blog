        <h2 id="avoid-spamming-a-default-resume-to-many-companies">Avoid Spamming a Default Resume to Many Companies</h2>
<p>Don’t send a generic resume to 100 different companies. Why? Because your resume is likely to be screened by AI or a non-technical person (e.g., HR, talent acquisition, or operations) in the first round. These people often look for patterns that match the job description to your resume. If they don’t see enough similarities, you’ll probably receive that infamous “we’ve decided not to proceed” email.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Customize your resume to match the job description. Focus on the key points and highlight your relevant experiences/expertise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="follow-specific-instructions-carefully">Follow Specific Instructions Carefully</h2>
<p>Many companies, especially top-tier ones, may ask you to include a specific keyword or flag in your resume to filter out “low-effort” applications. Always read the job description thoroughly for such instructions. (example “In your form submission below, be sure to include the phrase “red dot” in one of your responses.” , “Start your response with”The latest challenge …” (This helps us filter out low-effort applications)”</p>
<h2 id="prepare-for-screening-calls">Prepare for Screening Calls</h2>
<p>Before joining screening calls, research the company. Read about their previous interview questions on sites like Glassdoor, understand their core values, and clarify anything unclear about the job description, company culture, etc. Show them that you’ve done your research!</p>
<h2 id="prepare-for-coding-challenges">Prepare for Coding Challenges</h2>
<p>Many companies still have coding challenges, which may not relate directly to day-to-day tasks but instead test problem-solving and debugging skills. Spend time practicing these. Most companies, especially for non-research roles, don’t expect the most efficient solution—just one that compiles and passes most tests. During the challenge, ask questions to clarify requirements, and think aloud so the interviewer knows your thought process. They can correct misunderstandings and guide you toward a solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Some companies may also include “system design” or “low-level design” questions. There are plenty of YouTube videos to learn from, and I personally recommend the channel “Jordan Has No Life.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="take-home-assignments">Take-Home Assignments</h2>
<p>If given a take-home assignment (often a paid task), don’t just submit something that works. Employers expect you to maintain certain standards, such as clear package management, automation, testing (include at least basic unit tests; for tier 1 companies, consider property-based testing), documentation, logging, and granular privilege management. If they provide access to a cloud account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), ask for guidelines on permitted/prohibited actions. (Don’t worry too much—companies usually monitor activity with billing thresholds.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If your assignment involves architectural decisions, do your research and make logical choices. A senior engineer may ask you to explain why you selected a particular tool or approach over alternatives.
